# My own blog created with Oxapy

This blog is built using Oxapy, a high-performance HTTP library written in Rust. I created Oxapy with speed and efficiency in mind, aiming to provide a faster alternative to frameworks like Django and Flask, even compared with FastAPI. You can find Oxapy on my GitHub: [j03-dev/Oxapy](https://github.com/j03-dev/Oxapy). Oxapy's efficient Rust backend and simple API makes it an excellent option for web applications where performance is critical.
